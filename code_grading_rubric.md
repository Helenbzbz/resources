# Code Grading Rubric

Each assignment should be graded on each of 3 dimensions: ***Functionality***, ***Documentation*** and ***Style***. The final assignment grade will be based on a weighted average of each of these three grades with weights as follows: 

|   Dimension   | Weight |
| :-----------: | :----: |
| Functionality |  60%   |
| Documentation |  20%   |
|     Style     |  20%   |

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
### **Functionality**: 
- For assignments that have well-specified behavior, the code should be able to pass (or very nearly pass, e.g. there may be minor output formatting issues) automated unit testing of all required features. 
- For open-ended assignments the code must be easy to run without modification and implement all of the required functionality.
### **Documentation**:
- **All** functions are commented with appropriate *docstrings*. 
- For open-ended assignments there is a **README** file discussing how to run the program and what it is supposed to do.

### **Style**: 
- The program exhibits effective modular design. 
- The code does not have unnecessary cut and paste code or magic numbers. 
- Variable and function names are sensibly chosen.
- The code mostly follows the style recommended by [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐
### **Functionality**: 
- For assignments that have well-specified behavior, the code should implement all of the required functionality. For this grade, it is possible that 10-20% of the functionality may be broken. 
- For open-ended assignments it will be possible to get the code running with modest effort (i.e. it will not be as well documented as in a 5 stars, but it isn’t too hard to intuit how the code works).
- For these types of assignments all required features must be present, however, some (10-20%) may not be functioning properly or otherwise poorly implemented. 
- Pseudo-code is properly used.

### **Documentation**: 
  
- Some functions are missing *docstrings*. 
- Comments are fairly minimal.

### **Style**: 
  
- Some aspects of the design of the program could be improved to reduce cut and paste code. 
- Variable and function names are for the most part well-chosen.
- The code does not violate too much against the style recommended by [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## ⭐⭐⭐

### **Functionality**:
- The code should implement almost all of the required features (it is okay if roughly 20% are not implemented). 
- A significant portion, 30-50%, of the code may not work as it is supposed to. 
- Pseudo-code is fairly used.


### **Documentation**: 
- For well-defined assignments,*docstrings* are mostly absent and the code does not run as it should based on the assignment spec. 
- For open-ended assignments there may not be any indication of how to run the program, and it is not easy for grader to figure out how the code works (a good test is if you have to email someone to ask them how their code runs, they are probably at this level).

### **Style**:
- The program design needs improvement. 
- The code would be a lot cleaner if the author had done a better job thinking through the appropriate functional decomposition. 
- The code has lots of cut and paste and magic numbers.
- Variable and function names are hard to interpret.

## ⭐⭐
### **Functionality**: 
- The assignment is incomplete (~50% of the functionality is not implemented). 
- The functionality that is implemented is not 100% correct.
### **Documentation**:
- Documentation mostly absent.
### **Style**: 
- Design is poor. 
- Very little attention has been paid to choosing a sensible functional decomposition. 
- Variable and function names are chosen almost arbitrarily.

---
## ⭐
###  **Functionality**: 
- Only minimal functionality is present.
### **Documentation**: 
- Little or no documentation.
### **Style**: 
- No comments or *docstrings*. 
- Code is not “readable”. 
- Poor choice of variable and function names.
